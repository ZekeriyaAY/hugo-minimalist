# Minimalist

A minimalist personal theme for Hugo. It was ported from Jekyll theme [BDHU/minimalist](https://github.com/BDHU/minimalist).

## Installation
This theme uses Sass to generate CSS files so make sure you have the
*extended* Hugo version installed.

Add the theme to your site's `themes` directory:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/aniolm9/hugo-minimalist.git themes/hugo-minimalist
# if your website is not managed by git:
# git clone https://github.com/aniolm9/hugo-minimalist.git themes/hugo-minimalist
```

Update the theme option in `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "hugo-minimalist"
```
